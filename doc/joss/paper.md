<!--We acknowledge contributions from W. Nikolaus Probst, Marie Ryan, Jieun Seo, Verena Mühlberger and Kai W. Wirtz for providing feedback, data, fruitful discussions and for contributing to the ODD document. We thank all members of the MuSSeL consortium making this software relevant in a research context. The development of the model was made possible by the grants 03F0862A, 03F0862C, 03F0862D, 03F0862E "Multiple Stressors on North Sea Life" (MuSSeL) within the 3rd Küstenforschung Nord-Ostsee (KüNO) call of the Forschung für Nachhaltigkeit program of the Germany Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF). We are grateful for the open source community that facilitated this research, amongst them the developers of and contributors to NetLogo, Python, R, pandoc, and LaTeX. -->
