# OxyPOM and DiaMO: simple models for dissolved oxygen and biogeochemistry

OxyPOM (**Oxygen and Particulate Organic Matter**) and DiaMO (**Diagnostic Model for Oxygen**) are aquatic biogeochemical models that consider key processes for dissolved oxygen (DO), such as re-aeration, mineralization, and primary production, in fresh, transitional and marine waters.
Both are implemented in the `Fortran`-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models ([FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/)) for interoperability in a variety of hydrodynamic models, in realistic and idealized applications, and for coupleability to other aquatic process models.

## Description

- `OxyPOM` simulates oxygen consumption and production in aquatic ecosystems [(Holzwarth and Wirtz, 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2018.01.020) and resolves key biogeochemical processes as photosynthesis, respiration, mineralization, and nitrification.

- `DiaMO` is a simplification of `OxyPOM` useful when a complete representation of bio-geochemical dynamics is not needed,

The code of these models is located in the directory `./src` (e.g., `./src/oxypom` and `./src/diamo`), and future code developed as part of this model should be here included.

Together with `OxyPOM` and `DiaMO`, this repository includes the model `oxypom/light`: a second order correction for the calculation of photosynthetically active radiation depth profiles.

## Requirements

- This model requires:

  - `FABM` (v1 or above) available in [fabm github](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/).
    It can be cloned using `git clone https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm.git fabm`.

  - The physical driver:
    - `GOTM` (v6.0 latest stable release) available in [gotm github](https://github.com/orgs/gotm-model/repositories).
      It can be cloned using via `git clone --recursive https://github.com/gotm-model/code.git -b v6.0 gotm6`.

The following is not required to build and run the model but it is for running the test case:

- The script for downloading forcing and validation data requires the shell commands `wget`, `unzip`, and `sed`.

- The scripts for generating forcing files setup and plotting routines for model validation require `R` (v4.3 or above) available in [r home](https://www.r-project.org/) with the library [`ncdf4`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncdf4/index.html) installed.

## Testcases

We provide the model with a testcase in the directory `./testcases`.
New testcases for **OxyPOM** and **DiaMO** should be included in a single directory within `./testcases`.
Currently, we include the testcase "Estuary".

### Testcase Estuary

This setup uses the physical driver `GOTM` to simulate the water column dynamics in the Elbe estuary in 2005-2024.

1. To run the testcase go to the directory `./testcases`.

The model is build with the script `gotm-installation.sh`, in where these variables must be defined: - `GOTM_DIR` base directory of GOTM source code - `FABM_DIR` base directory of FABM source code - `OXYPOM_DIR` base directory of OxyPOM source code

By default they are:

    ``` bash
    export GOTM_DIR=$HOME/tools/gotm6
    export FABM_DIR=$HOME/tools/fabm/fabm
    export OXYPOM_DIR=$HOME/tools/oxypom/src
    ```

2. The script `gotm-installation.sh` creates the directory `./build` with the building files, and a copy of `gotm` executable in the `./estuary` directory.
   Now move to the directory `./estuary`.

3. The script `get_data.sh` download and unzip the forcing and validation data from [kuestendaten.de](https://www.kuestendaten.de) in a newly created directory `./data`.
   The downloaded files are used under license [DL-DE->Zero-2.0](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/zero-2-0).

4. The script `setup_data.R` formatted the data to be read by `GOTM`. It generates the file `meteofile.csv`.

5. Run the model with `./gotm`. It generates the files `output.nc` and `restart.nc`.

6. The script `plot_output.R` analyses the model output.

If everything is correct, the figure `estuary_validation.png` should be produced.
It displays a comparison of simulation and data for temperature and dissolved oxygen values.

The entire procedure is included in `./testcases/run-estuary-testcase.sh`.

### Testcase light

This setup uses the physical driver `GOTM` to simulate the water column dynamics in the Elbe estuary in 2005-2024 and compares the default light implementation with the provided by `oxypom/light`.

Follow steps 1-2 of the estuary testcase.

Now move to the directory `./light`.

- The script `model_comparison.R` analyses the model output.

If everything is correct, the figure `light_validation.png` should be produced.
It displays a comparison of simulations using the default light implementation with the provided by `oxypom/light`.

The entire procedure is included in `./testcases/run-light-testcase.sh`.
